==========

Expectations written in Python.


Example::

    expect([]).to_be_empty

    expect('').to_be_empty


where be_empty is a Should-DSL compatible matcher. See how to create a matcher
`here <http://packages.python.org/should_dsl/custom_matchers.html>`_.

Currently, Fingernail is only an experiment.
